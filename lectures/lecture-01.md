## Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing Systems

### Why study BI and DW systems?

- Broadly, two categories of information systems in enterprise IT:
  1. Systems for collecting and recording information about business activities: **_transaction processing systems_**
    - e.g. ERP systems, payroll systems, point-of-sale systems, inventory management systems, etc.
  2. Systems for **_collating and analysing_** information (typically collected from transaction processing systems) to support organisational decision-making.
- No IT professional can claim to understand enterprise IT without undersanding both kinds of systems.
- The approaches that work well for developing transaction proxcessing systems often don't work for decision support systems.
  - IT industry often tries to use transaction processing approaches: leads to high failure rate
  - Industry needs people to understand BI.
- **Business Intelligence is a key IT priority** for organisations:
  -

## Common Features in BI

- Data from lots of different souyrces, internal and external.
- 'Dashboards' provide overview and monitoring of performance.
- Ability to navigate from one report to another for investigation:
  - 'slice and dice'
  - 'drill down'
- Visualisation of data
  - Graphical
  - Textual

## Data and Business Intelligence

- BI systems have to:
  1. Acquire data
  2. Present it
- Where does the data come from?
  - Lots of different systems
    - Internal
    - External
    - Different data formats
    - Different database management approaches
    - Structured data
    - Unstructured data
- A Data Warehouse
  - Large, centralised database for storign data from transaction processing systems
- Provides a data storage layer that provides:
> "...a **subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile** collection of data in **support of managment's decisions**"
> Inmon and Hackathorn (1994)
